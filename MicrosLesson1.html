      <h1><strong>INTRODUCTION TO MICROPROCESSORS</strong></h1>
      <h6><em>By Isaiah Chiraira</em></h6>
      <h4>What is a Microprocessors?</h4>

      <ul class="sampletext">
        <li>
          A <strong>microprocessor</strong> is the central unit of a computer system that performs arithmetic and
          logic operations, which generally includes adding, subtracting, transferring numbers from one area to another,
          and
          comparing
          two numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is the heart of any computing system.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is often known simply as a processor, a central processing unit, or as a logic chip.
        </li>
        <li>
          The computing system can be a pc, calculator, remote control, smart TV, iPhone,
        </li>
        <li>
          The computing system can be an <strong>Embedded System</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <em>embedded system</em> is controlled by its own internal microprocessor without any external processor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The microprocessor in an embedded system is burned with a single purpose for single specific function needed
          for
          the system.
          For instance, the processor in a printer only getts data and prints it as opposed to the M1 chip in apple's
          MacBooks and iPad
          that has many functions like word processing, games, and internet connectivity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Microprocessor VS Microcontroller</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A Microcontroller comes with the CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O, Timers, Serial COM port under one chip
        </li>
        <li>
          A microprocessor contains no RAM, no ROM, and no I/O ports on the chip itself- just a stand alone CPU.
          The system designer using the microprocessor has to add those.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can think of it in the same way as a customisable gaming pc
        </li>
        <li>
          Microcontrollers are relatively cheaper, lower power consuming than microprocessors
        </li>
        <li>
          It is important to note that, microprocessors and microcontrollers do the same thing
        </li>
        <li>
          In this course, we will use a microcontroller.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Factors to consider when choosing a microcontroller</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed</strong> - What is the max Speed that the microcontroller can support.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Power consumption</strong> - How much the power consumed for performing a task.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amount of RAM and ROM on the chip</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This feels like buying a phone or a laptop.
      </p>

      <h4>The AVR Microcontroller Family</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed in 1996 by Alf-Egil Bogen and Vergard Wollen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stands for Advanced Virtual RISC though some say it's Alf Vegard RISC.
        </li>
        <li>
          RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many mebers of the AVR family
        </li>
        <li>
          All of the members except the AVR32, are 8-bit microcontoller, meaning that they can process only 8 bits of
          data
          at a time.
          Larger data have to be broken into smaller chunks before they can be processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members can be broken into four classes;
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Mega</li>
          <li>Tiny</li>
          <li>Special Purpose</li>
          <li>Classic</li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          We will work with the Mega for this course.
        </li>
      </ul>
